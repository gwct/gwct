09.11.17 -- version Beta 1.1:

Changes to gwct_codeml.py:
Small update to streamline the code of gwct_codeml.py
-Removed -s (seqtype), -b (branch site), -a (ancestral option), -l (log file), -x (output directory suffix) options.
-Replaced -p with --prune.
-Script now always tells PAML to do ancestral reconstructions.
-Changed PAML path option from -c to -p.

Changes to gwct.py:
-i is now the exact directory from a gwct_codeml.py run (and not the containing directory as before).
Removed -u option from gwct.py -> now always counts unique substitutions when -w is 0 or 1.
-o is now output directory and not output suffix
